# Langchain series 

This project was aimed at learning more about large language models and how to use them via langchain. It contains:

- Notebooks dedicated to learning how to use LangChain.
- a streamlit application which allows a user to query a self-uploaded PDF document

## Running instructions
If you'd like to run these notebooks and the application locally, install a python virtual environment using the environment.yaml file provided. Then, to run the app, run:
