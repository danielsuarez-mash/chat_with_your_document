# Langchain series 

This project was aimed at learning more about large language models and how to use them via langchain. It contains:

- a notebook which works through langchain's basic functionality
- a streamlit application which allows a user to query a self-uploaded document

## Running instructions
To run the notebook or the application, install the python environment using the environment.yaml file included in this repo. You will also need to have a HuggingFace API token saved in a .bash_profile file in your home directory. To run the application, run streamlit dashboard/app.py from the repo location.
